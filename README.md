A.	Full Stack development basics

Full stack web development is the process of designing, creating, testing, and deploying a complete web application. It involves developing both the front end and back end of the application. 
The front end consists of the user interface, while the back end handles the business logic and application workflows. The web development process has three layers: 
Business logic layer: The back end of the application
Presentation layer: The front end of the application
Database layer: The database
Full stack developers handle the entire software stack, including everything from the front to the backend. They create software, websites, databases, and applications. These professionals ensure that all software works together seamlessly.
