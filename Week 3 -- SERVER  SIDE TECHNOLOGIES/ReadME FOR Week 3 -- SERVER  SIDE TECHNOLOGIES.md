Week 3: 
•	Server-side Technologies – Server-side rendering, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Django
comprehensive plan
Back-End Development Basics:
Server-Side Languages:

Examples: Node.js (JavaScript), Python (Django, Flask), Ruby (Ruby on Rails), Java (Spring), PHP.
Basic Usage: Write server-side logic to handle requests, interact with databases, and perform business logic.
Databases:

Types: Relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra).
Basic Usage: Store and retrieve data, design database schemas, and optimize queries.
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):

Definition: APIs enable communication between different software systems.
Basic Usage: Design and implement RESTful or GraphQL APIs to allow data exchange between the front-end and back-end.
Server:

Examples: Express (Node.js), Flask (Python), Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby).
Basic Usage: Set up a server to handle HTTP requests, route requests to appropriate handlers, and manage application logic.
Authentication and Authorization:

Authentication: Verify the identity of users.
Authorization: Determine the access rights of authenticated users.
Basic Usage: Implement secure authentication mechanisms and control access to resources.
Security Best Practices:

Basic Concepts: Protect against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
Deployment and Hosting:

Examples: Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean.
Basic Usage: Deploy the application to a server, configure hosting environments, and manage deployment pipelines.
Testing:

Types: Unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing.
Basic Usage: Write tests to ensure the reliability and functionality of code.
